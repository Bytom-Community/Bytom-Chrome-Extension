    (1) store the user's wallet password (i.e. the password set by the user when creating/importing the wallet), private key, mnemonic word and Keystore;
    (2) retrieve the user's wallet password, private key, mnemonic word and Keystore;
    (3) frozen wallet;
    (4) report the loss of the wallet;
